Rationale
=========

I was really intrigued by the concept of jasper, a voice-controlled interface.
I needed it to be multi-lingual like me, so this library is my attempt to make having the
TTS engines multi-lingual. A lot of this code is based of code from the Jasper project,
just refactored to fit purpose and to be testable.

Basic Usage
===========

Install from pypi:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install talkey
